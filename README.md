# Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm `Aleksandar NikoliÄ‡`

## :point_right: About me

First and foremost, I love coding. I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve real-world problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I'm passionate about solving. I believe that programming is a great way to help improve the lives of people around the world.

My journey started in high school where I started grooming my love for programming. As my first accomplishment, Iâ€™ve built a digital library management software for the school I was studying in. At that point, Iâ€™ve figured out what Iâ€™m passionate about, and ever since I have been happily expanding my role as a software engineer. Today I a Full-Stack Javascript & React Developer @ [Future Forward](https://futureforward.nl/).

Even after working hours, I tend to improve my skills by trying out new technologies and programming languages. So far Iâ€™ve mastered React, React Native, Firebase, GraphQL, MongoDB, Typescript, Node.js, and more but that is not the end of it. Iâ€™m still eager to learn and Iâ€™m actively improving my skills in CI/CD, SQL, Next.js, Unit & E2E Testing!
